This is a very informative talk about how work is organized at GitHub and how they had to organized themselves as if they were an open source project due to not having office for the first years of existence and the fact that a good part of their employee are not living and working in the same geographical are and time zone.
In addition to the talk’s video, Ryan wrote a blog post about it.

The main ideas are:

+ use elecronical way of communicatng
+ every import bit of information or communication should have an url
+ the communications should be asynchronous
+ no blocking points

### Use electronical way of communication 

Most of the communication (if not all) should done in an electronic format. This could be email, chats, wiki, video and others. The idea here is that elecronical communication can leave traces. You can at any time get back to them for reference. This also allow people who couldn’t participate to the communication to join in at a later point in time.

If your communications require to be at a precise time and in a particular location then you are leaving out any people who couldn’t participate to it. You might miss some useful insight from other people and worse than everything the communications is “gone” as soon as the meeting is over. It only remains in the people brains as long as they can keep it in their brain. This is the best way to loose most information about what was discuss during the meeting and to have alternate version of the event as time does its work on people memories.

### Every important bit of information or communication should have an URL

This is such an import thing, that I cannot believe the idea didn’t occur to me earlier.

This is just the next step to follow after using electronic communications. If your give an URL to your communications they stay accessible to all for “ever”. You can search them, archive them, and come back to them when you need to. You can share it with everyone who could be interested in it.

In case a physical meeting happens you can always make a transcript of what has been discussed so that you can share with other people what has been said and discussed. If you have a chat system used by your organization make sure that transcript are made out of the discussions and that those transcripts are given an URL.

### Communication should be asynchronous

Most decision shouldn’t require the immediate answer. It might be acceptable or required in some cases, but if most of your communications must be synchronous then it might mean that something is not working properly in your organization. In such case the net result is that most of the people get interrupted so many time a day that they cannot concentrate on the work they have to do. And that’s where the office fails. If you put all the people in the same room then you are most certain that synchronous communications will become the mainstream. By forcing people to work remotely you then encourage asynchronous communications. You cannot expect any of your co-workers to be available for you at any time. They might just not be working right now or being outside for a walk if the need to get some fresh air.


### No single blocking point

The point of all this is that your organization shouldn’t be block because some decision must be taken and we are all waiting for someone to make that decision. Of course not everyone can take just any decision. The thing is that this decision should not prevent your from working. The decision could be made in a couple of hours (or days) but you should be able to proceed. If any individual become the central point of contact and decision then you won’t be able to scale as an organization. One person cannot attend the requests of 20 other persons (or 100). So you must delegate and and empower the people so that local small decision can be taken. If bad decision were made then just undo them, is that a bad thing? Is that impossible? In the software development world usually it is not. Code could be changed, adapted, modified, thrown away.


### How and when this is applicable

In my work at Liip I somehow have the feeling that we cannot apply the last principle. We all time work for a client on his request, on his project. He his the person who puts the money in and knows what we are trying to build. In such an environment you cannot let the worker make decisions without getting agreement from the project owner. This is a pity because then people working on the project don’t feel like they can steer the project in the direction they think it should go. Sometime you don’t even know in which direction the project is going anyway so let alone making decisions.

But in case of in house development (like github) then you surely can allow the organization to be self organized.
