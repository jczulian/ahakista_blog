This is a copy of an email I have sent to my team member. After telling them in many occasion that I dislike Skype and that I would like to change it to another IM tool, I have decided to write down a rather long explanation about what I dislike in Skype and why I think we should not use it. Here it is.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

You all know Skype as it is the tool we use on a daily basis for Instant Messaging (shorten IM from now on). You also know, or have heard that I dislike Skype. But what you may not understand is why I do no like Skype.

If you look at the surface of things Skype looks great, right? It offers free communications with any one around the world, it has client running on Windows, Mac and Linux. Even though the Linux client is the one always left behind when it comes to updates and features. It also offers an app ready to run on your mobile device (android or IPhone). And it is a free service, you can use it as much as you want without having to spend a dim. Under such conditions why would you think some one will not like Skype?

Now let's get back in history and see if there is something we can learn from it.

We all have a phone. I mean a landline phone. Ok, these days I would say that some of us don't have one and only have a mobile phone. Nevertheless try to bear with me. Phones were a great invention and have allowed people to communicate easily with other people leaving relatively far away from each other. One could talk to his mother in Italy after he migrated to France, or you could contact customers, providers or any collaborators in a few seconds even though they might be located hundreds of kilometeres away.

Now image Skype Corp. would have created the phone. What would it look like. Well first of all exit phone providers: no Swisscom, no Sunrise, no Cablecom. Basically no one to enter in competition with Skype Corp. No one to offer similar services at a better price, with a better quality. You simply have to be a customer of Skype Corp. if you want to call some one. That's because Skype Corp have made phone such as they can control the all communication chain. The protocol of communication is private and kept secret in order to make sure no competitor could break in and disrupt this beautiful communication dream. Beside the fact that you have no way to choose another company for operator, you also have to buy the devices (the phone itself) that Skype Corp. is making for you. They are not that great, not that sexy, neither cheap. But hey! Skype Corp. is in control, no one can make another (potentially better or cheaper) phone. 

Would you think Skype Corp. would have had any success?  Would you think that the world would have accepted such a situation where the world's communication are put into the hand of one company deciding everything, making every device you would need to use? Would you have like that? Me certainly not?

What about your lovely IPhone? Remember not so long ago Nokia was the king in the mobile phone world. If we would have been obliged to use phones from the same maker in order to call each other what would have been the result? Well, we would all have right now in our pocket a Nokia phone. Exit Android phones and your beloved IPhone. Only because what you really want is to talk to your friends and family, but they all have a Nokia and if you want to talk to them you _must_ have a nokia phone. 

Thankfully this also didn't happen. Why? Because the telecom world has learn since a long time that open and standard protocols are the way to go when it comes to communications. There is just no space for proprietary protocols. They create market fragmentation, and lockin situation. They prevent innovation and creativity.

Let's get back into the domain of IM. It depend of your age but you might have seen coming and going many of these proprietary tools for IM. Do you remember ICQ? proprietary software and protocol. ICQ reached a situation of monopole we could say. At some point every one had to use ICQ in order to talk to her friends. Do you remember AIM from AOL? Same thing, proprietary software and protocol, people were again forced to use it. MSN? Ho god I hate that one. I was force to use this thing on my linux box back at university because all my friends have been sucked in MSN. Again proprietary from start to finish. What else do we have? Well the list could go on and one. Since years if not decades we have put ourselves into the hands of almighty providers for our IM needs. When one was falling out of fashion for some reason we would jump into the arms of the next one. The funny thing to note is that all those tools I have mentioned are now dead (or at least diging their graves).

Back to our days. What do we see? Skype. Proprietary tool and protocol. The funny thing is that skype is not the king on the mobile world. There the new king is called Whatsapp. Every one is using this application on their mobile. The young generation (but also the not so young) are all using that. Imagine! My daughter's grand mother asked me if I was on Whatsapp so that we could quickly chat and share photos. You know what? We are maybe right now witnessing one of those 'falling out of fashion' scenario where the previous kind is slaughter and soon after every one shout 'long live to the new king'. Just think of it for a moment, if whatsapp comes out with a desktop version of their software, how long do you think Skype will resist? With all those people used to use whatsapp for IM on their phone. They could kill skype very quickly, or at least they could kill it slowly but surely. They have the future company makers (students) on their side. [Actually I should maybe send and email to Whatsapp and tell them to build the desktop version, and soon after buy some of their company's shares].

You see I am getting quite old [in computer time] and I grew tired of all those proprietary protocols and software. There is just no way to improve or innovate on those thing. They are like so unfertile that nothing can grow on them. They cannot evolve neither and always die sooner or later. Do you know how long has been the landline phone protocol leaving? Decades for sure and it is still here with us for many more decades. I can dig out from my basement a phone from the 80's, plug it in, and it will just work. Do you know for how long has been the GSM protocol leaving? Maybe not decades but for sure it will leave for very long. What about VoIP? This one is quiet young but it will be the future of telecommunication. Why? open standardized protocol, independent of any vendors or makers.

The list of example could got on: email, tcp/ip, http are just other few example where openess and standardization has allowed every one, every computer, every handheld device to communication with each others.

Maybe now you start to understand why I do not like Skype. In the same way that I didn't like MSN and for the same reason I don't like Whatsapp. They lock you in, they kill innovation, they have no long lived future.

Maybe it is time also for me to elaborate what I think is missing from Skype. Yes Skype if far from being perfect in my mind. Beside the fact that us on Linux always have the worst version of their software available. I have it crashing many times every week and it is lacking features compared to other versions. But other things really annoys me:

1/ Conversations are travelling in clear on the internet. Basically every one could listen to what you are saying, there is no privacy. But I am sure you never gave password to a co-worker on skype. No, no that has never happen. Neither did I send the dump of Raiffeisen database to some one over skype (Oupss! or did I?). This situation is even worst in the light of the NSA scandale unfolding since weeks. Also keep in mind that Skype is now property of Microsoft, which apparently is pro actively cooperating with the NSA.

2/ Conversations are not archived. I hear you. you gonna tell me "Yes, they are! You can get back the complete history of you conversation". I do not call that archived or archivable. To be archivable you should be able to get them and dump them into a file. Then the file could be backed up, copied as much as you like and however you like it with the tool you like.

3/ Converstations are not searchable. And again: No! the search feature of Skype is not what I call searchable. First of all you have to remember with whom you had the discussion about this damn Jira's ticket. Then you have to remember if it was a one-to-one discussion, or if the discussion happend in the team channel, the guild channel, the project channel, the company channel (in that case very unlikely). Why cannot I search across all converstations? Why canno I seach by date?

4/ Conversations have no URL. Today I am a strong believer that in the internet world in which we live in if something doesn't have a URL it simple doesn't exist. How can I reference a conversation to a new liiper telling him "look we had this discussion the other day, here is the link have a look at it first". How can I access a old conversation if it doesn't have a URL. How can we make it public and share it with every one?

5/ And the worst is that I cannot do anything to fix those problems. The whole thing is proprietary, I cannot invent, create, fix those problems. I just have to live with whatever Skype think is good for me. And apparently they are not good at thinking and improving their tool.

6/ Skype is not a great product, we are skype's product. Why do you think EBay, and now Microsoft bought over skype. Certainly not for the few thousands of line of code. No it is neither for the talentuated people working at Skype. What they bought is us. You and me. The large skpye's user account list. That's what they are buying. Remember if something is given to you for free it is very likely that you are not using their product but that you _are_ their product which they are selling and making money from.

There might be other things that Skype is missing but those are my main pain points.

Today at the daily you said that switching to something else than Skype is a lost battle that is not even worth fighting. Believe me you are wrong. Skype will be displaced sooner or later. And the battle is definitely worth fighting. I have been fighting it peacefully, relentlessly for many years already. I haven't won it yet for sure though! But I am sure that this proprietary protocol and software for our IM needs will have to end one day. There is just no other possible way. It might take another decade to fix this crazy situation but it will happen for sure and I will not stop thinking that using skype is not the solution but rather the problem.

PS: Maybe to make my point even more poignant I will not use skype till the end of the year. I will use Google hangout, yeah another proprietary thing, we for sure gonna love it. I am just quiting one lockin situation for another one, I am just taking one step ahead of every one. At the same time you couldn't possibly complain. The whole company is already in hangout because we all have google account. Talk to you there... 

Are you still thinking it is a worthless battle?
