### Review

I have to admint that I had a hard time this week to keep up with my blog writing challenge. I have barely written three posts, counting this one. Maybe we could say that I was not particularly into a writting mode this week, or that I was lacking inspiration. In any cases I have to correct that. I should somehow plan some time for writing so that I won't get caught by the end of the week with very little blog posts writen.

So this week there was two things I wanted to highlight.

The first is that I got started on the course CS262 from Udacity. I have a full [blog post](/2013-11-10-staring-cs262-from-udacity) about it so I won't elaborate further on this here. 

The second one is that I am really getting into Yoga and Meditation. I have started practicing Yoga some weeks ago, and the more I practice the more I like it. I am trying right now to attend a class every week. In addition to that I have found that there are many ressources online. So that you can actually have a Yoga class at home. Just go to youtube find a 45 minutes or 1 hour class and off you go. This is really handy for the week when I couldn't make it to the "real class". Beside that I am practicing meditation more constantly now. I have managed the last 2 weeks to spare 15 minutes time 5 night out of 7 to have a little meditation session.

These two activities are of great help for me. For instance one thing they have brought me is a better concentration. I am still doing my touch typing exercices, and I am bringing into it things I have learn from meditation and yoga. I have witnessed that with a greater concentration and calmeness my typing speed increases and more importantly the accuracy is getting really good. I am sure I will see more benefit to these two activities. But just the fact that I love practicing Yoga and Meditation is enough for me to continue with them.
