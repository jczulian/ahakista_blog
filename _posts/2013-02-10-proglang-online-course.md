Last automn I have being following the ProgLand online course offered by Shriram Krishnamurthi and his team from the Brown University.

Although the pace of the course was way above the amount of time I could invest in it I managed to watched all the course’s recorded video. I also started reading through the manual that Shriram was writing while giving the course. I didn’t managed to read it all yet and even less to follow it by writing the code and examples that are in it.

I really enjoyed following this course even though I couldn’t dedicate enough time to follow it completely and do the exercises. But now all these wonderful materials are online and still available. So when time allows I will continue working through the book and maybe completing the assignments.

You can find the course’s website [here](http://cs.brown.edu/courses/cs173/2012/OnLine/) and all video lectures are available on [youtube](http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCnnzngrRZdRKdPsjGh5b1YA).
