### Review
It seems like this week I was not so good at tracking what I have been doing. Or maybe I didn't do much this week.

I have finally got myself a full subscription to Focus@Will. I have been using the website for a couple of month and I really enjoyed it. But I grew tired of listening again and again to the same music. With the subscription the music limit is removed and you can listen to music for a long time before encountering again the same track. Focus@will has been a great help for me at work as it has enable me to isolate myself from ambient noise and discussion and also help me staying concentrated on my tasks instead of getting distracted by the smallest of any events happening around me. Definitely a good buy.

Beside that I haven't been able to progress at all on my CS262 class. Normally Friday is day dedicated to work on it, but this Friday I was busy with other stuff that I had to deal with. Next Friday I will also have to do some stuff but I should be able to dedicate some hours to it anyway.
