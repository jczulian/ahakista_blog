### Review
This week I have took the following decisions: 

#### I want to switch to Zsh
 it seems that Zsh is packed with many useful feature to make you more productive on the command line. I have been putting off for a long time this switch, having heard about Zsh a long time ago. But now I feel it is time to invest a bit on Zsh and see what advantages I can gain from it.

#### I want to switch to Tmux
I have been using Gnu Screen for many years now. Screen is extremelly cool, when I first discovered it, I didn't understand what it was all about. Later on I came across it and decided to dig deeper. Then I understood it an since then Screen has been with me every single day of my life (in front of a computer). When I heard about Tmux, I thought that it might just be at best a good replacement for Screen but didn't see any compelling advantages of using it instead of Screen. Now it seems that Screens as follen out of fashion. It is apparently with some long existing bug (I haven't met any) and is more or less not maintained anymore. Tmux seems to offer a recent implementation of a terminal multiplexer with some new features that are lacking or awkwards in Screen. I will have to redo my configuration and learn those new features offered by Tmux. I have already bought a book on Tmux from the Pragmatic Programmer. I haven't read it yet but will surely do in a near future.


### Plover and the stenography input method
I stumble upon Plover this week and stenography. Even though I had heard previously about the word stenography I actually never investigate on it. After watching a presentation video about Plover and stenography I found it really interesting. Stenography is basically a different way to type on a keyboard: instead of typing letters one after the other you actually "type" syllables on the keyboard. This allows one to type way faster and more accurately than one normally would do on a regular keyboard. The presenter, a professional stenographer, achieves 240 words per minute. This is simply an amazing number. Compared to my current 60-65 words per minute, it is like she is playing in the top league when I am in the amateur one. She even say that with some few months of practice an average stenographer can reach 160 word per minute. This is about the same speed as the fastest touch typer. If you know someone touch typing at this speed you are witnessing a rare individual I believe.
Obviously as someone spending so much time in front of a computer and typing on it, the idea of typing that fast is extremely appealing to me. Right now my goal is to achieve a speed of 80wpm and I am hard at work to reach this speed. Thinking that a normal speed for a stenographer is 20 to 40 words per minute more than goal seems unrealistic.
I won't be learning steno now, but I definitely want to keep that in mind as a way to send my typing skill into another realm.

### I am learning Python and Django
Since a week or two I really invested some time into learning Python and Django. I found both of them really easy to use and I enjoy working with them a lot. I guess I will continue on that during the following weeks so expect some more blog post on these two topics.
