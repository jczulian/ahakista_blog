### Review
Yoga is eating up my blog. Since I got into yoga I have been giving to the practice a substancial amount of time. I usually manage to put 2 yoga session every day, one in the mornin and one in the evening. This is great and I extremelly love this time. The downside of it being that I have way less time for other activities, as I usually do yoga for 30 minutes to 1 hours every days. And my blogging activity is severely suffering form that. It has been 2 weeks in a row that I didn't manage to publish any blog post beside the weekly review. And even those one have shorten significantly. 

Nevertheless I don't want to give up on bloggin nor on yoga. I really like both of them. And the each bring useful thing into my life. But sure enough as I am working my daily 8 hours in front of computer at work I tend to prioritize Yoga when I am not at work in order to bring some balance. I don't find it healthy to spend an insane amount of hours daily sitted at a desk typing on a computer (eventhough I enjoy it).
