Since I have resurrected my blog I have large ambitions for it. I want to make blogging a daily habit and to write an many different topics (not alway about technical topic). 

In term of quantities I aim at writing at least three blog posts per week. This should be the minimal goal. The optimal goal would be to write seven blog posts per week. That is one blog post every day.

Although this seems to be quite a lot I really think it is achievable. Blog posts don't always have to be lenghty, so even on busy day I should try to write some content. Even if I cannot finish the blog post on the same day this would allow me to finish it the day after and maybe to complete it with another small one.

There are many reasons why I want to impose this rhythm on me:
- it forces me to find every day a topic for which I should investigate and write about it
- it encourages me to understand better what I think I have understood.
- it is a way to improve my touch typing skill
- it is a way to improve my english
- if I blog sporadically it is hard, if I blog daily and make it an habit it becomes easy
- it leaves a written proof of things I have learned and came across
- it strenghten my memory as I can read past the blog posts and refresh my remembering of past action or learning.

I am sure I will discover more advantages to this future habit and I am sure there will be other blog post on this topic.

For the moment I want to keep this rhythm till the end of the year. Then I will reevaluate and decide if I want to continue or not like this.
