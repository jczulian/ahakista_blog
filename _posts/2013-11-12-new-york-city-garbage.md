These are the notes I took from the talk [Robin Nagle gave at Ted](http://www.ted.com/talks/robin_nagle_what_i_discovered_in_new_york_city_trash.html)


- Every day New York city produces 11'000 tons of garbage
- There is a huge work force operating every day to clean up after us
- This ocnstant flow of cleaning allows the rest of the society to work
- What happens if garbage collection stops for a few days
    - diseases start to appear and propagate
    - terrible smell in the street
    - whole economy slows down
- Collecting garbage is one of the ten most dangerous work, due to:
    - traffic passing clisely to the worker at full speed
    - hazardeous material in garbage
    - lack of recognition and respect for these people

Be extremly thankful to them for they clean up _our_ mess that we leave behind.
