This week I have been busy learning Django web framework. I have worked my way through the official [tutorial](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.5/intro/tutorial01/). I have finished it and all the code is on [Github](https://github.com/jczulian/Django_tutorial).

Unfortunately I wasn't able to achieve my blogging goals this week. I have only two blog posts published if we excluded the weekly review one. I will have to organize myself better if I want to be able to publish blog post more frequently.

Also I feel that this week I didn't get enough training. It is somehow missing 1 hour of real physical training. I had plans and time to do it but things turned out differently than what I expected and I couldn't make it to the gym.

### Blog posts 
<ul>
{% for post in site.posts %}
{% capture bday %}{{ post.date | date: '%d' }}{% endcapture %}
{% capture bmonth %}{{ post.date | date: '%m' }}{% endcapture %}
{% capture byear %}{{ post.date | date: '%Y' }}{% endcapture %}
{% if byear == page.year and bmonth == page.month and bday >= page.start_day and bday <= page.end_day %}
    <li>
      <a href="{{ post.url }}">{{ post.title }}</a>
    </li>
{% endif %}
{% endfor %}
</ul>
