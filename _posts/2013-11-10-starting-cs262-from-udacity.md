So this week I got started on the course CS262 from Udacity. I had some weeks ago started to watch the course lectures but somehow I stopped and it went of radar since then. But now it is a new start and I am committed to go till the end.

At work we have this concept of year goals. Every year we have to chose a set of goals, between 3 to 5 goals usually that we have to accomplish during the year. One of my goal this year was to attend a Postgres class. Due to some scheduling conflict and the fact that there is not that many quality Postgres courses I realized some weeks ago that I won't be able to reach this goal. So I decided to change it into attending a Symfony2 course. Here again it wasn't not possible to attend a single class, it was already too late to register and no new sessions were planned in the near future. So I had to search for quite sometime to find a replacement goal. 

And finally I found it. Remembering that I had watched some lecture from CS262, I thought that I could make a year goal out of this course. The nice thing about it is that all the material is available online and you can attend the course whenever you want. Of course this course requires way more time than it would have required to attend the postgres or symfony2 courses. I think that CS262 will take me up to 10 or 15 days of work. We have some allocated time from work that we can use for our further education and I must be left right now with only 3 or 4 days. So definitely I will have to put on personnal time in order to make it through the course. But I am really motivated and I really want to go till the end of the course this time. I have to now. The goal has been set so that it is reached only if I reach the end of the course.

I have already a rough idea of my study plan. Currently I am working 80%. That means that I am off one day per week, normally on Friday. I have decided to use this day to work every week on CS262. If I can go through a full unit during this day that would be great but I don't particularly count on that. I know that sometime more time will be required to view all the course videos of a particular unit. In addition I am trying to get involved with the material heavily, so I am not just passively watching the videos. I do the quizzes, exercises and add some experimentations on my own in order to make sure that I understood the ideas and concepts of the lesson.

I have found the IPython environment to be an incredible tool for that. I can record all learning I am doing. I have the python code of the quizzes and their solutions in one single document that I can revisit, complement or modify as much as I want. Since I have discovered IPython 2 weeks ago I have become completely sold to this tool. I will also try to replace my shell (bash) with it.

Of course if I engaged in this course it is not only because I had too (due to the year goals). I am really interested in the topics taught in the course. Although I know it won't be too deep, it will give me some good understanding about lexing, parsing and how to write a small interpreter for JavaScript. It won't be deep but broad and it will be a great starting point from which I could dig deeper on those topics.

So be prepared to see more blog posts coming out about me progressing on the CS262 course.
