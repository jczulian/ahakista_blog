### Review
Oops too bad!!! This weeks 0 blog posts.

I was not really in the writing mood this week, that's the least we can say. I do have plenty of blog post waiting to be writen so definitely inspiration is not lacking, it's rather that I didn't take the time to write, or that I was simply not willing to write.

#### Yoga, Yoga, Yoga
Anyway to big event this week is definitely the fact that I am really really getting into Yoga. As you can see down below I have spent 4 hours this week practicing Yoga spread over 5 sessions ranging from 30 minutes to 1 hour and 30 minutes length. I have discovered a great online resource to practice yoga from home: [www.myyogaonline.com](http://www.myyogaonline.com/)

With it you have access to hundreds of yoga classes. You can search classes by duration, type or teacher and you are certainly sure to find something to you tastes. It is really practical as it can accomodate any scheduling or planning you have. If you have 45 minutes available early in the morning, 30 minutes late in the evening or 2 hours during the weekend you will always find a [recorded] teacher ready to start a class just for you right away. Definitely a great thing.

Surely it doesn't replace a real teacher that can correct you or adapt the teaching according to your needs. But it is extremely convenient as you can practive from the confort of your home and exactly when you have some time available to give to yoga. Perfect when you have a busy life with work and family. Also the teachers are supposed to be of good quality as they are all experienced and reknown teachers. At least that's what the web site says. As I am still a yoga beginner I cannot really judge the technical competences of the teachers. I can only say so far if I'd like the teaching. And up till now it as been great, and some classes are really awesome.

#### Udacity CS262
I have made some good progress this week on the CS262 course. I have finished Unit 2 and already went through a good part of Unit 3. It is definitely fun to work with Python and Ply (the lexing, parsing library). I am really looking forwards the rest of the course and see what new thing I will learn with it

#### HipChat is gaining some ground
Turns out that the little experiment I was running at work to try to replace skype by hipchat got some traction this week. In a couple of days it spread in the Zurich and Lausanne offices just by word of mouth. We are now 10 to 15 people using it. But the greatest thing was to discover that there are actually a lot of people quite unhappy with skype and ready to make the move to something else. I will let it mature and we will see if we can get more people using it. In addition with two members from the management already using it, it makes me confident that one day we would actually replace skype for our internal communications. Let see what the future will bring us...
